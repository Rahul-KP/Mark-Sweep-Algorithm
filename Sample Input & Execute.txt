Algorithm

1. make a binary tree
2. unlink any one of the nodes
3. traverse the tree and perform mark operation 
	if the node exists then ,
			set marked bit to 1

sweep phase 
4. only for the nodes for marked bit is set to zero is pushed to a new linked list

Execute

1. Demonstration needs debugger.
2. Compile the code as gcc gc.c -g -o gc.exe
3. next run gdb gc

4. set desired break point
5. delete a node to create garbage nodes
6 .run display garbage function
7. copy the address of any garbage node
8. verify that the addresses have the values previously entered
9. now run free memory
10.in gdb use command x/w 0x<address> to display the value at that location
11.The resulting output will be different from the previously entered value
